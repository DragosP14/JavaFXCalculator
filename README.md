# JavaFXCalculator

The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Each operation is performed one turn at a time. It is not possible to perform several mathematical operations at the same time: 20.5 + 43.2 : 2 will not work.

Operations in parentheses are not supported.

After each operation, the text is deleted and a new operation is started from the beginning.

The calculator does not keep a history of operations.
